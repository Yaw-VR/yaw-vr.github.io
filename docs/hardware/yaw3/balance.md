# Balancing the Simulator

As you add peripherals and your body weight to the simulator, the center of balance may shift. To counterbalance the added load, add weight plates located behind the seat. This adjustment helps maintain stability and control during operation.

**Goal:** achieve neutral balance when sitting in the seat with the simulator powered off.

**Tip:** Move seat forward/backwards to reduce the amount of weight you need to add.

**Weight Plate Specifications:**

- Maximum Diameter: 240mm
- Maximum Height (combined using provided holding bolt): 44mm

For precise placement, 3D models that centralize both Olympic and Non-Olympic weight plates have been created by ItsVRK. These models are freely available at <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/632564" target="_blank">Yaw 3 Motion Simulator Weight Plate Guide</a>.
