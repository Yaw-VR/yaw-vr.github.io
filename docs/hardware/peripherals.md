# USB Peripherals

Connect your USB peripherals by plugging them into the available USB ports at the rear of the Yaw 2/3 simulator. To access them on your computer, set up the [Virtualhere](../../software/virtualhere.md) client, which allows you to access connected devices as if they were physically plugged into your PC.

## Using a Powered USB Hub

If you have more than 4 USB devices, consider purchasing a powered USB hub to ensure all devices receive sufficient power. The simulator supports up to 4 directly connected USB devices.

## Connecting Devices

With the simulator powered on, connected USB devices should be recognized by the VirtualHere client on your PC. If they don't appear immediately, try:

* Unplugging and re-plugging them
* Restarting the VirtualHere client

## Using Peripherals

Configure peripherals in each game as you would with any peripheral directly connected to your computer.

## Troubleshooting USB Device Recognition

If issues arise, follow these steps:

1. **Update VirtualHere Client**: Ensure the VirtualHere client is up-to-date.
2. **Check Driver Updates**: Verify that drivers for your USB devices are current.
3. **Test Direct Connection**: Connect devices directly to a PC to confirm they function correctly.
4. **Restart Simulator and PC**: Restart both devices to resolve any connectivity issues.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to successfully connect and use your USB peripherals with the Yaw 3 simulator.
