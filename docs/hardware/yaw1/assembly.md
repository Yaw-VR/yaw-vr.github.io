ALWAYS KEEP THE RIGHT BALANCE TO AVOID WHEEL SLIPPING. IT CAN DAMAGE THE SHELL.<br />
With player in the simulator if the shell doesn't move by itself, but it's easy to move it by hand in any direction, the shell is balanced well. You can adjust the balance if it is necessary. The seat balance can be adjusted by sitting forward or backward.<br />
To keep the balance during the game, please don't make large movements with your body.
